            Algo - Euler's Method

Input: x,y - Initial values of x and dY_dX
       h - Step length
       a - value to calculate
Output: Display the value of y at x=a
Data Structure: One dimensional array of elements
Discussion: here, F is a function that is equivalent to its mathematical equation

Steps:

1: Start
2: Read x,y
3: Read h
4: Read a
5: i ← 0
6: While x[i] < a double
    6.1: y[i+1] ← y[i] + h*F(x[i],y[i])
    6.2: x[i+1] ← x[i] + h
    6.3: i ← i+1
7: EndWhile
8: Print a,y[i]
9: Stop
