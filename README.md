# C-Numerical-Methods

Welcome to the C-Numerical-Methods repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting course assignments and projects related to Numerical Methods implemented in the C programming language. The primary focus is on providing a collection of numerical methods implemented in C, and each method may have corresponding pseudocode or algorithmic explanations stored in the Algorithms subfolders.

## Getting Started

To explore the numerical methods implemented in this repository, you can navigate to the individual `.c` files in the root directory. Each file represents a specific numerical method, and you may find additional explanations or pseudocode in the corresponding Algorithms subfolders.

## Compilation

Compiling the C code in this repository is straightforward. You can use a C compiler like Clang or GCC. Alternatively, we provide a simple `make` build system to streamline the compilation process. Here are some examples:

- To compile a debug build of a specific file, run:
  ```
  make name-c-file
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  make gauss-siedel-method
  ```
- To generate a release build of a specific file, run:
  ```
  make release-name-c-file
  ```
  This will create a release build with the same name.
