           Algorithm-Newton Raphson Method

Input:- 
    1. The initial guess of the root (initial_guess)
    2. The function F(x)
Output:-
    1. The root of the equation F(x)
    2. If the root is not found with the initial guess, then a message is printed

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Read initial_guess
3: x0 ← initial_guess
4: For i=0 to MAX_ITERATION do // MAX_ITERATION is defined by the user
    4.1: fx ← F(x0)
    4.2: dfx ← Fbar(x) //derivative of F(x)
    4.3: If |x| < epsilon then //epsilon = 1e-6
        4.3.1: Print "Error: Division by zero"
        4.3.2: Exit
    4.4: EndIf
    4.5: x1 ← x0 - fx/dfx
    4.6: If |x1-x0| < epsilon then
        4.6.1: Print x1, " is the root of the equation."
        4.6.2: Exit
    4.7: EndIf
    4.8: x0 ← x1
5: EndFor
// we reach here if the method does not converge
6: Print "Maximum number of iterations reached."
7: Stop
